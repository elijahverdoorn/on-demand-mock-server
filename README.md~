# Collins IMS FlightPlans API

_A Microservice API utilizing Node JS and Express._

_What_: Flight Plans Microservice API supports the targeted POC for IMS. To learn about the IMS see [confluence].

## Prerequisites

### NPS

Flight Plans API uses [nps] to define and execute npm scripts without the cost of a bloated package.json and the limits of JSON.

`npm start` is defined (in `package.json`) as an alias for `nps`, hence all scripts are run via `npm start <...>`

## Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.dx.utc.com/utdx/collins-ims-flight-plans-api
cd collins-ims-flight-plans-api
```

Install all dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

Run api in a terminal window:

```sh
npm start
```

Run integration tests in a terminal window:
